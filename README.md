# proxy-server
a proxy server residing in the cloud (AWS, Google, etc.) that will allow the users to do two things:
●	Access both HTTP and HTTPS Web sites that are otherwise not reachable by the user directly (Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel) 
●	Access an HTTP site where certain resources can be compressed on the fly by the proxy (which saves bandwidth for the user)
